#### Proxy server
<sub>A proxy server is a system or router that provides a gateway between users and the internet. Therefore, it helps prevent cyber attackers from entering a private network. It is a server, referred to as an “intermediary” because it goes between end-users and the web pages they visit online.</sub>

<sub>This server is designed to block websites defined in a text file. We will use Axum’s http-proxy example and add the feature to block the websites.</sub>
